feat: Implement advanced test sharding, smart retry mechanisms, and performance optimizations

üöÄ Major Features Added:

‚úÖ Test Sharding Implementation
- Configured 3 shards per browser (chromium, firefox, webkit) for parallel execution
- Enhanced GitHub Actions matrix to run 9 desktop + 2 mobile + 1 performance = 12 parallel jobs
- Added browser-agnostic global setup with lightweight mode for sharded execution
- Implemented proper environment variable passing for shard configuration

‚úÖ Smart Retry Mechanisms
- Created RetryHelper class with multiple retry strategies:
  * withSmartRetry() - Intelligent error-based retry logic
  * withExponentialBackoff() - Scaling delay mechanisms
  * retryStep() - Function-level retry wrappers
- Added error-specific retry strategies for timeout, network, element, and navigation errors
- Implemented smart retry conditions that avoid retrying assertion errors
- Created comprehensive retry examples in tests/retry-examples.spec.js

‚úÖ Performance Optimizations
- Added browser-specific launch arguments for optimal performance:
  * Chromium: Disabled web security, IPC flooding protection, renderer backgrounding
  * Firefox: Configured fake media streams and disabled permissions
  * WebKit: Disabled web security for faster execution
- Optimized timeouts: 15s action, 30s test, 10s expect timeouts
- Enhanced worker configuration: 2 for CI, 50% CPU locally
- Added memory optimization with NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
- Implemented global setup/teardown with performance monitoring

üîß Infrastructure Improvements:

‚úÖ Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow
- Fixed global setup browser compatibility issues
- Simplified and corrected sharding matrix configuration
- Added performance testing job with dedicated browser optimization
- Enhanced report merging with unified HTML output
- Added comprehensive error handling and notifications

‚úÖ Environment Configuration
- Created .env.example with all available configuration options
- Enhanced playwright.config.js with environment variable support
- Added new npm scripts for different testing scenarios:
  * test:retry, test:timeout, test:performance, test:sharded
- Implemented environmentConfig.js helper for centralized configuration

‚úÖ Documentation & Examples
- Updated README.md with comprehensive command reference
- Added IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md with detailed feature documentation
- Created performance.perf.spec.js for performance testing examples
- Enhanced troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
